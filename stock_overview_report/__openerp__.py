Adds a wizard which takes a stock level snapshot from all warehouses at a time specified.
The report displays stock level of products per company and warehouse and allows grouping.
Due the snapshot of the data, changing filters is quick since data does not need to be
recalculated, which is slow for stock level calculations.
